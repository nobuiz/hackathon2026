"""
Deepgram voice intake — phone referrals arrive as audio.

transcribe(audio_path) -> text
  - DEEPGRAM_API_KEY set  -> real Deepgram transcription
  - no key                -> returns a baked phone-referral transcript so the demo still runs

The transcript then flows into the SAME pipeline (run_pipeline) as a typed request,
so a spoken referral gets the identical extraction + flagging + audit trail.
